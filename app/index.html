                <h2>Miguel</h2>
                <p>It was a fine morning. The bright sun glittered off the dew drops. It was a cool sight to see. It amazed even Miguel, who saw the same sight every day on him farm in Romania. He was a Hawaiian male, about 8 feet tall, who had moved to Romania just 3 months ago. He managed to buy a section of property behind a garbage dump and he now owned a small farm. As the dew shimmered with sunlight, the stench of rotten eggs and moldy bread filled his nostrils. He grimaced. Toxic fumes swirled in his brain. He developed an unknown disease and dies right there on the spot just two seconds later. Poor Miguel.</p>
                <h2>Pina & Colada</h2>
                <p>Once there was a peanut. Her name was Pina. She was from Spain; a quiet little almond born in the late months of the year. As she grew older - by now she was nearly 15 years old and still living in the same bag she had been in for as long as she could remember - she began to grow soft, her innards slowly rotting away. Pina was very uncomfortable in her cramped habitat. Peanuts of all various shapes and sizes lay around her. Elbows jammed into ribs, knees poked painfully into cheekbones, and long thin almond fingers and toes pushed into eyes for all those years. It was time to do something about it. Pina and her friend Colada, a plump cashew that sat beside her, were determined to get out of this wretched bag. But the one day they decided it was time to go, they were plucked out of their places, plopped into a wet mouth, and ground between molars. Poor Pina and Colada.</p>
